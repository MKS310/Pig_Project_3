/*
#1.	Output the birth city of the player who had the most at bats (AB) in his career. */

(Cincinnati)

/* #2.
Output the top three birthdates that had the most players born. I am only looking for day and month combinations.
For instance, how many were born on February 3rd, how many were born on March 8th, how many were born on July 20th…
print out the top three dates. */

/* #6.
A player who hits well and doesn’t commit a lot of errors is obviously a player you want on your team.
Who were the top 3 players from 2005 through 2009 (including 2005 and 2009) who maximized the following criterion:
 (number of hits (H) / number of at bats (AB)) – (number of errors (E) / number of games (G))
The above equation might be skewed by a player who only had 3 at bats but got two hits.
To account for that, only consider players who had at least 40 at bats and played in at least 20 games over that entire 5 year span.
You should note that both files contain a number of games column. The 20 game minimum is from the Fielding file.
Be aware that some players played for multiple teams during that 5 year span. Also be aware that a player could have played multiple
positions during that span (see for instance, buchabr01 in 2004 who played LF, OF and RF in the same season).
You may need a UDF for this problem.

/* #7.
Sum up the number of doubles and triples for each city/state combination.
Output the top 5 city/state combinations that produced the players who had the most doubles and triples.

/* #8.
Output the birthMonth/state combination that produced the worst players.
The worst players are defined by the lowest of:  (number of hits (H) / number of at bats (AB))
  To ensure 1 player does not skew the data, make sure that at least 5 people came from the same state and were born in
the same month. For this problem, the year does not matter. A player born in December, 1970 in Michigan and a player born
in December, 1982 in Michigan are in the same group because they were both born in December and are from Michigan.
